To add a project, you would typically need to go to your JIRA instance, click on projects, and then click the \"Create Project\" button. However, since you mentioned \"AI Hackathon F3\", I'm assuming you want to create a project with that name. Unfortunately, I don't have the capability to create projects directly. If you need help with anything else, such as creating a ticket or getting issues, I'd be happy to assist you."
